                <p>The system provides farmers with personalized recommendations based on the specific conditions of
                    their farm, which can help them to make informed decisions about crop selection and fertilizer
                    usage. The fertilizer prediction and crop prediction model developed in this study has the potential
                    to reduce fertilizer usage, minimize the negative impact of excess fertilizer on the environment,
                    maximize yields and minimize losses due to crop failure.</p>
                <p>this part takes 8 paramaters then it will predict the best crop to be cultivated. the 8 parameters
                    that this system takes are temperature,moisture, humidity, Soiltype, crop Type, nitrogen, potassium,
                    phosphorous.
                </p>
                <p>The farmer has to collect the amount of each element that he can get aroun his farm and the put this
                    system and will get the best crop to be cultivated based on that collect elements of data .</p>
                <p>Each of these elements have maximum and minimum numbers that the user must enter other wise the
                    system will throw error so that use the credentials we will list below .</p>
                <h3 class="text-danger">Notice :</h3>
                <p>The miminum and maximum numbers are based on the dataset that we used .</p>
