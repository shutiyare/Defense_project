                <p>Crop recommendation are designed to recommend things to
                    the user based on many different factors. These systems predict the most likely product that the
                    users are most likely to purchase and are of interest to. Companies like Netflix, Amazon, etc. use
                    recommender systems to help their users to identify the correct product or movies for them. </p>
                <p>this system takes 7 paramaters then it will predict the best crop to be cultivated. the 7 parameters
                    that this system takes are temperature, humidity, Rainfall, Ph, nitrogen, potassium, phosphorous.
                </p>
                <p>The farmer has to collect the amount of each element that he can get aroun his farm and the put this
                    system and will get the best crop to be cultivated based on that collect elements of data .</p>
                <p>Each of these elements have maximum adn minimum numbers that the user must enter other wise the
                    system will throw error so that use the credentials we will list below .</p>
                <h3 class="text-danger">Notice :</h3>
                <p>The miminum and maximum numbers are based on the dataset that we used .</p>
